Simple Time Tracker
===================

This time tracker is simple. It only handles registering when you have done
something. No clients. No projects. No description. This is for those who
just want to keep track of how long they have spent on _one_ specific task.

This is ideal for people who work at the same place and want to keep track
on how many hours they have been working throughout a day.

Simple Time Tracker will never grow more complicated than tracking starting,
stopping, and entering specific times. It might get more clients and ways
to enter time, but that's it.
